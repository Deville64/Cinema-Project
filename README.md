# Cinema-Project

A website from where you can :

-Login/register to your account.

-Search movie information with The Movie Database API. (https://www.themoviedb.org/)

-Create an event to see a movie with people. You have to select a place on the map with Leaflet API (https://leafletjs.com/), select a date and time, then you should pick a movie, select how many people can come, write a description and create the event. 

The website is an old project that allowed me to learn HTML/CSS, JavaScript for front end, and PHP with altorouter + a SQL database (MariaDB) for back end.
